- Create a new script made to add queries
- database.insert should not swallow all errors. Saw this error while inserting docs that don't follow indexes
- Use mocha without mocha-as-promised. Promises are now supported
- Manage server with mutliple names [ { name: 'Aggra (PortuguÃªs)', slug: 'aggra-portugues' },
  { name: 'Grim Batol', slug: 'grim-batol' } ]
- Improve error management with node-rest-client
- Why is the logger not global...?
